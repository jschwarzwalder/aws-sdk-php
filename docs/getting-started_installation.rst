Installing the |sdk-php|
========================

.. meta::

   :keywords: AWS SDK for PHP, php for aws, install AWS SDK for PHP
   
You can install the |sdk-php| by using:

* Composer
* The prepackaged phar in the SDK
* The ZIP file in the SDK

Installing by Using Composer
----------------------------

`Composer <http://getcomposer.org>`_ is the recommended way to install
the |sdk-php|. Composer is a tool for PHP that manages and installs the dependencies of your project.

1. Type the following at the command line to install Composer.

   ::

       curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

2. Type the Composer command to install the latest stable version of the SDK.

   ::

       php composer.phar require aws/aws-sdk-php

3. Require the Composer autoloader in your scripts.

   .. code-block:: php

       <?php
       require 'vendor/autoload.php';
       ?>

For more information on how to install Composer, configure autoloading, and follow other best
practices for defining dependencies, see `getcomposer.org <http://getcomposer.org>`_.

Installing by Using the Packaged Phar
-------------------------------------

Each release of the |sdk-php| includes a prepackaged phar (PHP archive) that contains all the classes
and dependencies you need to run the SDK. Additionally, the phar automatically registers a class
autoloader for the |sdk-php| and all its dependencies.

You can `download the packaged phar <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.phar>`_
and include it in your scripts.

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    require '/path/to/aws.phar';



.. note::

    Using PHP with the Suhosin patch is not recommended, but is common on Ubuntu and Debian distributions.
    In this case, you might need to enable the use of phars in the suhosin.ini. If you don't do this,
    including a phar file in your code will cause a silent failure. To modify suhosin.ini, add the
    following line.

    ::

        suhosin.executor.include.whitelist = phar

Installing by Using the ZIP file
--------------------------------

The |sdk-php| includes a ZIP file containing all the classes and dependencies you need to run the SDK.
Additionally, the ZIP file includes a class autoloader for the |sdk-php| and its dependencies.

To install the SDK, `download the .zip file <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/download/aws.zip>`_,
and then extract it into your project at a location you choose. Then include the autoloader in your scripts, as follows.

::

    require '/path/to/aws-autoloader.php';
