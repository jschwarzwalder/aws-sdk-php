Working with Security Groups in |EC2|
=====================================

.. meta::
   :description: Create, describe, and delete security groups for Amazon EC2 using the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords: Amazon EC2 code examples for PHP

An |EC2| security group acts as a virtual firewall that controls the traffic for one or more instances. You add rules to each security group to allow traffic to or from its associated instances. You can modify the rules for a security group at any time. The new rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group.

The following examples show how to:

* Describe one or more of your security groups using :aws-php-class:`DescribeSecurityGroups </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#describesecuritygroups>`.
* Add an ingress rule to a security group using :aws-php-class:`AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#authorizesecuritygroupingress>`.
* Create a security group using :aws-php-class:`CreateSecurityGroup </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#createsecuritygroup>`.
* Delete a security group using :aws-php-class:`DeleteSecurityGroup </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#deletesecuritygroup>`.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.
