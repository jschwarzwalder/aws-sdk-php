Working with |IAM| Policies
===========================

   :description: Create, attach, or remove AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user policies.
   :keywords: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) code examples, AWS SDK for PHP

You grant permissions to a user by creating a policy. A policy is a document that lists the actions that a user can perform and the resources those actions can affect. By default, any actions or resources that are not explicitly allowed are denied. Policies can be created and attached to users, groups of users, roles assumed by users, and resources.

The following examples show how to:

* Create a managed policy using :aws-php-class:`CreatePolicy <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#createpolicy>`.
* Attach a policy to a role using :aws-php-class:`AttachRolePolicy <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#attachrolepolicy>`.
* Attach a policy to a user using :aws-php-class:`AttachUserPolicy <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#attachuserpolicy>`.
* Remove a user policy using :aws-php-class:`DetachUserPolicy <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#detachuserpolicy>`.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.
