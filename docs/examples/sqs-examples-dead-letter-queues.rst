Using Dead Letter Queues in |SQS|
=================================

.. meta::
   :description: Enable dead letter queues with Amazon SQS using the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords: Amazon SQS code examples for PHP

A dead letter queue is one that other (source) queues can target for messages that can't be processed successfully. You can set aside and isolate these messages
in the dead letter queue to determine why their processing did not succeed. You must individually configure each source queue that sends messages to a dead letter
queue. Multiple queues can target a single dead letter queue.

To learn more, see :SQS-dg:`Using SQS Dead Letter Queues <sqs-dead-letter-queues>`.

The following example shows how to:

* Enable a dead letter queue using :aws-php-class:`SetQueueAttributes <api-sqs-2012-11-05.html#setqueueattributes>`.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.

Credentials
-----------

Before running the example code, configure your AWS credentials. See :doc:`guide_credentials`.
