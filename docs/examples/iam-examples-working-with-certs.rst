Working with |IAM| Server Certificates
======================================

   :description: List, update, and get information about certificates using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
   :keywords: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) code examples, AWS SDK for PHP

To enable HTTPS connections to your website or application on AWS, you need an SSL/TLS server certificate. To use a certificate that you obtained from an external provider with your website or application on AWS, you must upload the certificate to |IAM| or import it into |ACMlong|.

The following examples show how to:

* List the certificates stored in |IAM| using :aws-php-class:`ListServerCertificates <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#listservercertificates>`.
* Retrieve information about a certificate using :aws-php-class:`GetServerCertificate <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#getservercertificate>`.
* Update a certificate using :aws-php-class:`UpdateServerCertificate <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#updateservercertificate>`.
* Delete a certificate using :aws-php-class:`DeleteServerCertificate <api-iam-2010-05-08.html#deleteservercertificate>`.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.

Credentials
-----------

Before running the example code, configure your AWS credentials. See :doc:`guide_credentials`.
