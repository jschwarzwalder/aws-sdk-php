Configuring |S3| Buckets

   :description: Get or set CORS configuration for an Amazon S3 bucket using the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords: Amazon S3 code examples for PHP

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to interact with resources in a different domain. With CORS support in |S3|,
you can build rich client-side web applications with |S3| and selectively allow cross-origin access to your |S3| resources.

For more information about using CORS configuration with an |S3| bucket, see :S3-dg:`Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) <cors>`.

The following examples show how to:

* Get the CORS configuration for a bucket using :aws-php-class:`GetBucketCors <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#getbucketcors>`.
* Set the CORS configuration for a bucket using :aws-php-class:`PutBucketCors <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#putbucketcors>`.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.

Credentials
-----------

Before running the example code, configure your AWS credentials. See :doc:`guide_credentials`.

Get the CORS Configuration
--------------------------

Create a PHP file with following code. First create an AWS.S3 client service, then call the ``getBucketCors`` method and specify the bucket whose CORS configuration you want.

The only parameter required is the name of the selected bucket. If the bucket currently has a CORS configuration, that configuration is returned by |S3| as a
:aws-php-class:`CORSRules object </api-s3-2006-03-01.html#shape-corsrule>`.

**Imports**

   :lines: 19-23
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/s3/GetBucketCors.php
   :lines: 31-
   :language: php

Set the CORS Configuration
--------------------------

Create a PHP file with following code. First create an AWS.S3 client service. Then call the ``putBucketCors`` method and specify the bucket whose CORS configuration you want
to set, and the CORSConfiguration as a :aws-php-class:`CORSRules JSON object </api-s3-2006-03-01.html#shape-corsrule>`.
