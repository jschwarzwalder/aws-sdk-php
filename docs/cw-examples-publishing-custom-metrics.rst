Publishing Custom Metrics in |CWlong|
=====================================

.. meta::
   :description: Publish metric data and create alarms for Amazon CloudWatch using the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords: Amazon CloudWatch code examples for PHP

Metrics are data about the performance of your systems. An alarm watches a single metric over a time period you
specify. It performs one or more actions based on the value of the metric, relative to a given threshold over a number of time periods.

The following examples show how to:

* Publish metric data using :aws-php-class:`PutMetricData </api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#putmetricdata>`.
* Create an alarm using :aws-php-class:`PutMetricAlarm </api-monitoring-2010-08-01.html#putmetricalarm>`.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.

Credentials
-----------

Before running the example code, configure your AWS credentials. See :doc:`guide_credentials`.
