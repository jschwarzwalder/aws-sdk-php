|S3| Client Side Encryption
===========================

.. meta::
   :description: Client-side encryption for the |sdk-php| |S3| client.
   :keywords: |sdk-php| constructor, |sdk-php| client configuration

The |sdk-php| provides an ``S3EncryptionClient``. With client-side
encryption, data is encrypted and decrypted directly in your environment. This
means that this data is encrypted before it's transferred to |S3|, and you
don’t rely on an external service to handle encryption for you.

The |sdk-php| implements :KMS-dg:`envelope encryption <workflow>`
and uses `OpenSSL <https://www.openssl.org/>`_ for its encrypting and
decrypting. The implementation is interoperable with :AWS-gr:`other SDKs that match its feature support <aws_sdk_cryptography>`.
It's also compatible with :doc:`the SDK’s promise-based asynchronous workflow <guide_promises>`.

Setup
-----

To get started with client-side encryption, you need the following:

* An :KMS-dg:`AWS KMS encryption key <create-keys>`
* An :S3-gsg:`S3 bucket <CreatingABucket>`

Encryption
----------

Uploading an encrypted object through the ``PutObject`` operation takes a similar
interface and requires two new parameters.

.. code-block:: php

    // Let's construct our S3EncryptionClient using an S3Client
    $encryptionClient = new S3EncryptionClient(
        new S3Client([
            'region' => 'us-east-1',
            'version' => 'latest',
        ])
    );

    $kmsKeyArn = 'arn-to-the-kms-key';
    // This materials provider handles generating a cipher key and
    // initialization vector, as well as encrypting your cipher key via AWS KMS
    $materialsProvider = new KmsMaterialsProvider(
        new KmsClient([
            'region' => 'us-east-1',
            'version' => 'latest',
        ]),
        $kmsKeyArn
    );

    $bucket = 'the-bucket-name';
    $key = 'the-upload-key';
    $cipherOptions = [
        'Cipher' => 'gcm'
        'KeySize' => 256,
        // Additional configuration options
    ];

    $result = $encryptionClient->putObject([
        '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
        '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key' => $key,
        'Body' => fopen('file-to-encrypt.txt'),
    ]);

.. note::

    In addition to the |S3| and |KMS|-based service errors, you might
    receive thrown ``InvalidArgumentException`` objects if your
    ``'@CipherOptions'`` are not correctly configured.

Decryption
----------

Downloading and decrypting an object requires only one additional parameter on
top of ``GetObject``, and the client will detect the basic cipher options for you.
Additional configuration options are passed through for decryption.

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $encryptionClient->getObject([
        '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
        '@CipherOptions' => [
            // Additional configuration options
        ],
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key' => $key,
    ]);

.. note::

    In addition to the |S3| and |KMS|-based service errors, you might
    receive thrown ``InvalidArgumentException`` objects if your
    ``'@CipherOptions'`` are not correctly configured.

Cipher Configuration
--------------------

``'Cipher'`` (string)
    Cipher method that the encryption client uses while
    encrypting. Only 'gcm' and 'cbc' are supported at this time.

.. important::

    PHP is `updated in version 7.1 <http://php.net/manual/en/migration71.new-features.php>`_
    to include the extra parameters necessary to `encrypt <http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-encrypt.php>`_
    and `decrypt <http://php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-decrypt.php>`_
    using OpenSSL for GCM encryption. As a result, using GCM with your
    ``Aws\S3\Crypto\S3EncryptionClient`` is only available on PHP 7.1 or later.

``'KeySize'`` (int)
    The length of the content encryption key to generate for
    encrypting. Defaults to 256 bits. Valid configuration options are 256,
    192, and 128.

``'Aad'`` (string)
    Optional 'Additional authentication data' to include with your
    encrypted payload. This information is validated on decryption. ``Aad`` is
    available only when using the 'gcm' cipher.

Metadata Strategies
-------------------

You also have the option of providing an instance of a class that implements
the ``Aws\Crypto\MetadataStrategyInterface``. This simple interface handles
saving and loading the ``Aws\Crypto\MetadataEnvelope`` that contains your
envelope encryption materials. The SDK provides two classes that implement
this: ``Aws\S3\Crypto\HeadersMetadataStrategy`` and
``Aws\S3\Crypto\InstructionFileMetadataStrategy``. ``HeadersMetadataStrategy``
is used by default.

.. code-block:: php

    $strategy = new InstructionFileMetadataStrategy(
        $s3Client,
        '.instr'
    );

    $result = $encryptionClient->putObject([
        '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
        '@MetadataStrategy' => $strategy,
        '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key' => $key,
        'Body' => fopen('file-to-encrypt.txt'),
    ]);

Class name constants for the ``HeadersMetadataStrategy`` and
``InstructionFileMetadataStrategy`` can also be supplied by invoking
`::class`.

.. code-block:: php

    $result = $encryptionClient->putObject([
        '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
        '@MetadataStrategy' => HeadersMetadataStrategy::class,
        '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
        'Bucket' => $bucket,
        'Key' => $key,
        'Body' => fopen('file-to-encrypt.txt'),
    ]);

.. note::

    If there is a failure after an instruction file is uploaded, it will
    not be automatically deleted.

Multipart Uploads
-----------------

Performing a multipart upload with client-side encryption is also possible. The
``Aws\S3\Crypto\S3EncryptionMultipartUploader`` prepares the source stream for
for encryption before uploading. Creating one takes on a similar experience to
using the ``Aws\S3\MultipartUploader`` and the ``Aws\S3\Crypto\S3EncryptionClient``.
The ``S3EncryptionMultipartUploader`` can handle the same ``'@MetadataStrategy'``
option as the ``S3EncryptionClient``, as well as all available ``'@CipherOptions'``
configurations.

.. code-block:: php

    $kmsKeyArn = 'arn-to-the-kms-key';
    // This materials provider handles generating a cipher key and
    // initialization vector, as well as encrypting your cipher key via AWS KMS
    $materialsProvider = new KmsMaterialsProvider(
        new KmsClient([
            'region' => 'us-east-1',
            'version' => 'latest',
        ]),
        $kmsKeyArn
    );

    $bucket = 'the-bucket-name';
    $key = 'the-upload-key';
    $cipherOptions = [
        'Cipher' => 'gcm'
        'KeySize' => 256,
        // Additional configuration options
    ];

    $multipartUploader = new S3EncryptionMultipartUploader(
        new S3Client([
            'region' => 'us-east-1',
            'version' => 'latest',
        ]),
        fopen('large-file-to-encrypt.txt'),
        [
            '@MaterialsProvider' => $materialsProvider,
            '@CipherOptions' => $cipherOptions,
            'bucket' => 'bucket',
            'key' => 'key',
        ]
    );
    $multipartUploader->upload();

.. note::

    In addition to the |S3| and |KMS|-based service errors, you might
    receive thrown ``InvalidArgumentException`` objects if your
    ``'@CipherOptions'`` are not correctly configured.
