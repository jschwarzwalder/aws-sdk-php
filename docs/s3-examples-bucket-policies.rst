Working with |S3| Bucket Policies
=================================

.. meta::
   :description: Return, replace, or delete Amazon S3 bucket policies using the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords: Amazon S3 code examples for PHP

You can use a bucket policy to grant permission to your |S3| resources. To learn more, see `Using Bucket Policies and User Policies <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html>`_.

The following example shows how to:

* Return the policy for a specified bucket using :aws-php-class:`GetBucketPolicy <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#getbucketpolicy>`.
* Replace a policy on a bucket using :aws-php-class:`PutBucketPolicy <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#putbucketpolicy>`.
* Delete a policy from a bucket using :aws-php-class:`DeleteBucketPolicy <api-s3-2006-03-01.html#deletebucketpolicy>`.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.

Credentials
-----------

Before running the example code, configure your AWS credentials. See :doc:`guide_credentials`.
