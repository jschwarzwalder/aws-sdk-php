Signing Custom |CSlong| Domain Requests
=======================================

   :description: Making a Cloud Search domain request using the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords: Amazon Cloud Search, AWS SDK for PHP examples, Cloud Search for PHP code examples


|CS| domain requests can be customized beyond what is supported by the |sdk-php|.
In cases where you need to make custom requests to domains
protected by |IAM| authentication, you can use the SDK's credential providers and
signers to sign any :aws-php-class:`PSR-7 request <class-Psr.Http.Message.RequestInterface.html>`.

For example, if you're following :CS-dg:`Cloud Search's Getting Started guide <getting-started>`
and want to use an IAM-protected domain for :CS-dg:`Step 3 <getting-started-search>`,
you would need to sign and execute your request as follows.

.. code-block:: php

    use Aws\Credentials\CredentialProvider;
    use Aws\Signature\SignatureV4;
    use GuzzleHttp\Client;
    use GuzzleHttp\Psr7\Request;

    // Prepare a CloudSearch domain request
    $request = new Request(
        'GET',
        'https://<your-domain>.<region-of-domain>.cloudsearch.amazonaws.com/2013-01-01/search?q=star+wars&return=title'
    );

    // Get your credentials from the environment
    $credentials = call_user_func(CredentialProvider::defaultProvider())->wait();

    // Construct a request signer
    $signer = new SignatureV4('cloudsearch', '<region-of-domain>');

    // Sign the request
    $request = $signer->signRequest($request, $credentials);

    // Send the request
    $response = (new Client)->send($request);
    $results = json_decode($response->getBody());
    if ($results->hits->found > 0) {
        echo $results->hits->hit[0]->fields->title . "\n";
    }
