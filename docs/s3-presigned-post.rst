|S3| Pre-Signed POSTs
=====================

   :description: Create write access to private |S3| data using the |sdk-php|.
   :keywords: |S3|, |sdk-php| examples, |S3| for PHP code examples

Much like pre-signed URLs, pre-signed POSTs enable you to give write access to a
user without giving them AWS credentials. Pre-signed POST forms can be created
with the help of an instance of :aws-php-class:`Aws\S3\PostObjectV4 </class-Aws.S3.PostObjectV4.html>`.

To create an instance of ``PostObjectV4``, you must provide the following: 

- instance of ``Aws\S3\S3Client``
- bucket
- associative array of form input fields
- array of policy conditions (see :s3-dg:`Policy Construction <HTTPPOSTForms>` in the |S3-dg|)
- expiration time string for the policy (optional, one hour by default).

.. code-block:: php

    $client = new \Aws\S3\S3Client([
        'version' => 'latest',
        'region' => 'us-west-2',
    ]);
    $bucket = 'mybucket';

    // Set some defaults for form input fields
    $formInputs = ['acl' => 'public-read'];

    // Construct an array of conditions for policy
    $options = [
        ['acl' => 'public-read'],
        ['bucket' => $bucket],
        ['starts-with', '$key', 'user/eric/'],
    ];

    // Optional: configure expiration time string
    $expires = '+2 hours';

    $postObject = new \Aws\S3\PostObjectV4(
        $client,
        $bucket,
        $formInputs,
        $options,
        $expires
    );

    // Get attributes to set on an HTML form, e.g., action, method, enctype
    $formAttributes = $postObject->getFormAttributes();

    // Get form input fields. This will include anything set as a form input in
    // the constructor, the provided JSON policy, your AWS access key ID, and an
    // auth signature.
    $formInputs = $postObject->getFormInputs();
