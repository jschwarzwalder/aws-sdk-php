Using Regions and Availability Zones for |EC2|
==============================================

.. meta::
   :description: Describe AWS Regions and Availability Zones for Amazon EC2 using the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords: Amazon EC2 code examples for PHP

|EC2| is hosted in multiple locations worldwide. These locations are composed of AWS Regions and Availability Zones. Each Region is a separate geographic area, 
with multiple isolated locations known as Availability Zones. |EC2| provides the ability to place instances and data in multiple locations.

The following examples show how to:

* Describe the Availability Zones that are available to you using :aws-php-class:`DescribeAvailabilityZones </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#describeavailabilityzones>`.
* Describe AWS Regions that are currently available to you using :aws-php-class:`DescribeRegions </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#describeregions>`.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.

Credentials
-----------

Before running the example code, configure your AWS credentials. See :doc:`guide_credentials`.
