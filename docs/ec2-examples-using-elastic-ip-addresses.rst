Using Elastic IP Addresses with |EC2|
=====================================

.. meta::
   :description: Describe Amazon EC2 instances and acquire, associate, and release Elastic IP addresses using the AWS SDK for PHP.
   :keywords: Amazon EC2 code examples for PHP

An Elastic IP address is a static IP address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account. It's a public IP address, 
which is reachable from the internet. If your instance does not have a public IP address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the internet.

The following examples show how to:

* Describe one or more of your instances using :aws-php-class:`DescribeInstances </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#describeinstances>`.
* Acquire an Elastic IP address using :aws-php-class:`AllocateAddress </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#allocateaddress>`.
* Associate an Elastic IP address with an instance using :aws-php-class:`AssociateAddress </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#associateaddress>`.
* Release an Elastic IP address using :aws-php-class:`ReleaseAddress </api-ec2-2016-11-15.html#releaseaddress>`.

All the example code for the |sdk-php| is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/php/example_code>`_.
